    "## Domain Backgroud (Telecom Churn Stroy)\n",
    "\n",
    "I’m working as a data analyst at a telecommunications company, which I refer to as TeleComCoTeleComCo provides phone and internet services to a wide range of customers, and, as with most telecoms, customer churn—when customers stop using our service—is a key concernHigh churn rates lead to lost revenue and may signal customer dissatisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, in the last quarter, we noticed a rise in customers leaving for competitorsIn response, our management tasked my team with investigating the reasons behind this churn and developing a model to predict which customers are most at risk of leavingThe purpose is to identify these customers in advance and proactively offer them incentives to stay.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I’ve been given a dataset detailing account information for both past and current customers, along with data indicating whether or not each customer eventually churnedMy primary responsibilities include:\n",
    "- Analyzing this dataset to detect patterns and factors associated with customer churn.\n",
    "- Building a predictive model (specifically using logistic regression) to estimate churn risk for individual customers.\n",
    "- Through this data exploration, I expect to identify patterns such as:\n",
    "- Customers with longer tenures are generally less likely to churn, while newer customers may be at greater risk.\n",
    "- Those with certain types of plans or higher monthly charges might be more inclined to leave, possibly due to the cost factor.\n",
    "- Demographic details could influence churn—for instance, senior citizens may use our services differently or have specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer preferences, like opting for paperless billing or bundling phone and internet, might also relate to their likelihood of churning.\n",
    "By thoroughly investigating these factors and building the predictive model, we aim to help TeleComCo understand why customers leave and reduce future churn through timely interventions."

    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of customer records, each with a variety of features describing the customer and their service usage. Below is an overview of each column in the data:\n",
    "- `customer_id:` A unique identifier for each customer (e.g., a UUID). This is just an ID and not useful for prediction.\n",
    "- `customer_email:` The email address-of the customer. This is an identifier as well and not directly useful for the model.\n",
    "- `age:` The age of the customer (in years). This could be related to churn if different age groups have different service preferences.\n",
    "- `senior_citizen:` Whether the customer is a senior citizen or not (boolean: true/false). Typically, this might be derived from age (e.g., age > 65).\n",
    "- `partner:` Whether the customer has a partner or not (boolean). This indicates if the customer is married or in a long-term partnershipIn telecom, having a partner\n",
    "might mean family plans or shared services.\n",
    "- `dependents:` Whether the customer has dependents (children or other dependents) or not (boolean) Customers with dependents might have different usage (e.g.,family plans).\n",
    "- `tenure_months:` The number of months the customer has been with the company. Higher tenure might indicate loyalty; low tenure customers are newer and might be more likely to churn if they haven't established loyalty.\n",
    "- `phone_service:` Whether the customer has phone service with the company (boolean). Some customers might only have internet service; this feature tells if they also subscribed to phone.\n",
    "- `paperless_billing:` Whether the customer has opted for paperless billing (boolean). This could be a proxy for tech-savvy behavior or convenience preference.\n",
    "- `monthly_charges:` The amount `$` charged to the customer every month. This is like their monthly bill. Customers with higher bills might churn due to cost, or those with very low bills might churn if they are not using many services.\n",
    "- `total_charges:` The total amount `$` the customer has been charged since joining (this is roughly monthly_charges * tenure, plus any extras). This can indicate the overall value of the customer; low total charges might mean the customer is relatively new or has a low-cost plan.\n",
    "- `churn:` The target variable - whether the customer has churned (true = yes, the customer left; false = no, the customer is still with the company). This is what we want to\n",
    "predict.\n",
    "- `last_interaction_date:` The date of the last interaction with the customer (could be the last service use or last customer support call, etc.). This might give insight into how recently the customer was active. Customers with very old last interactions might have silently churned.\n",
    "- `region:` The geographic region or state where the customer resides (e.g., Ohio, California, etc.). Different regions might have different market conditions or competitor\n",
    "presence, possibly affecting churn.\n",
    "- `signup_date:` The date when the customer originally signed up for service. (Note: This column is present in one of the source files. When we merge data, some records might not have a signup_date if it wasn't recorded for them.)\n",

    "## Potential Questions and Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above features, here are some questions that might arise and that we will explore in this project:\n",
    "- Do older customers or senior citizens tend to churn more or less than younger customers?\n",
    "- Does having a partner or dependents influence churn? (For example, do single customers churn more often than those with family plans?)\n",
    "- How does tenure relate to churn? Are newer customers more likely to leave compared to long-term customers?\n",
    "- What about monthly charges? Are customers with high monthly charges more likely to churn (perhaps due to higher cost), or could it be that those with low charges churn because they might not be fully utilizing the service?\n",
    "- Are there any regional trends in churn? (We might check if certain regions have higher churn rates.)\n",
    "- How do features like phone service or paperless billing correlate with churn? (e.g., maybe paperless billing users are more engaged or maybe less personal interaction leads to higher churn?)\n",
    "- Are there outliers or unusual values in charges or tenure that need special attention?\n",
